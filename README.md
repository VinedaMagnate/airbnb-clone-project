### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system is critical for success because it directly impacts the user's journey. By providing clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and a responsive layout, we can reduce friction, increase the likelihood of a user completing a booking, and improve overall customer satisfaction.


### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying these design properties from a mockup is crucial for several reasons. It ensures consistency across the entire application, which is essential for a professional and cohesive user experience. By having a defined style guide with colors and typography, all developers and designers on the team can maintain a consistent visual language, making the application easier to build and more predictable for the user. It also saves time by providing a clear reference point, preventing guesswork and rework.
